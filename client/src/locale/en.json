      "title": "What is the Model Context Protocol?",
      "paragraph1": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.",
      "paragraph2": "With MCP, AI systems can maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets, replacing today's fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture. Instead of building custom connectors for each data source or AI model, developers can now build against a standard protocol.",
